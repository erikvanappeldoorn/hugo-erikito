Top level programs is a new feature proposed for C# 9.0. With Top level programs a C# Hello Erikito example is not more then:

``` C#
using System;

Console.WriteLine("Hello Erikito!");
```

There is no more need for all the usual boilerplate code, so no namespace, no  program class and no main entry point. 

To be able to run this top level program example you will need the .NET 5 runtime. .NET 5 is not released yet. So install the latest version, currently [SDK 5.0.100-preview.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

The next step is to create a new .NET 5 console app:

`dotnet new console`

C# 9.0 is not released yet, so to be able to run this top level program we will have to tweak the .csproj file:

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Please note the additional line:
```xml 
<LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>
``` 
This is currently needed to be able to use unreleased C# 9.0 features.

Now you are ready to go, just type `dotnet run` and off you go.
